# Hey, I'm Molly!

🌆 I’m an Urban Data Scientist with an MSc in Urban Data Science & Analytics and a strong interest in using data to understand and address the social and spatial inequalities that shape everyday life in cities. I’m currently working as a Data Scientist at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA), where I focus on translating complex data into policy‑relevant, accessible insights.

My background is in Sociology with Quantitative Research Methods (BSc), which grounded my technical work in social theory and equity-focused thinking. I enjoy working with large, messy datasets and I’m particularly drawn to geospatial analysis, and interactive data visualisation as tools for supporting fairer urban and food policy.

- 💼 💼 **Current work:** Developing an interactive tool comparing the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and the Priority Places for Food Index (PPFI) to highlight hidden food access vulnerabilities across England
- 💻 **Tools I use:** Python, R, QGIS, Tableau
- 📬 R**each me:** sarg.mol2@gmail.com
